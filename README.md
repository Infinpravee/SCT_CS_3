Password Strength Assessment Tool
Overview
Welcome to the Password Strength Assessment Tool! This handy Python script helps you evaluate the strength of your passwords. By analyzing your input against some straightforward criteria, it will categorize your password into one of four levels: Strong, Moderate, Weak, or Very Weak. Understanding your password's strength is crucial for keeping your online accounts safe, and this tool encourages you to create stronger, more secure passwords.

Features
Length Check
One of the simplest ways to enhance your password's security is by making it longer. This tool checks if your password is at least 8 characters long. Longer passwords are harder for attackers to guess, so this is a great first step in boosting your password strength.

Character Diversity
To add an extra layer of security, the tool examines the variety of characters in your password. It looks for:

Uppercase Letters: Having at least one uppercase letter (A-Z) can make your password more complex.
Lowercase Letters: Including lowercase letters (a-z) adds variability, making it tougher to crack.
Numeric Digits: Adding at least one number (0-9) introduces numerical elements, further increasing complexity.
Special Characters: Finally, the tool checks for special characters like @$!%*#?&. These symbols can really enhance your password's strength.
Strength Evaluation
After evaluating your password, the tool will classify it into one of four categories:

Strong: Your password meets all four criteria, making it quite secure—great job!
Moderate: It meets three out of four criteria. It's decent, but there’s still room for improvement.
Weak: If your password meets only two criteria, it may be vulnerable to attacks, so you should consider strengthening it.
Very Weak: Meeting fewer than two criteria means your password is at high risk. Time to rethink it!
User Interaction
Using the tool is easy! When you run the script, you’ll be prompted to enter a password. After you input it, the tool will evaluate it and let you know how strong it is. This straightforward approach encourages you to take charge of your password security.
